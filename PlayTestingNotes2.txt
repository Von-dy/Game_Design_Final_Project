Play-Testing Notes	11/17/2017 (Before Meeting)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- "*-" means it is a new note that has been added, or it is a note that has been updated.
- As mentioned before, some of these may have been glossed over and have been already fixed, or be subjective.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Player is able to jump while crouched. Can stay, just wanted to note it.

- Player is able to "save a jump" if they walk of a ledge without jumping. 
Can stay, if wanted, but just wanted to note it.

- Player can get stuck on the side of a platform is they keep moving trying towards the platform. 
This can stay as a feature since we are a virus and don't have work like a person, but still, wanted this noted.

- If player crouches while they are in dodge state, meaning if they dodge, and then crouch while still dodging, 
the player is taken out of the dodge state and crouches. Can stay if wanted as a way to break out of dodge.

*- Crouching causes screen to shake

*- Crouch does not make hitbox smaller

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Main Menu
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Possibly more instructions on how to navigate the menu, such, up and down for selecting between 1 or 2 players, 
and what key actually selects their option

- Locking in a character no longer shows the "ready" on the selection screen

- Current background menu colors are somewhat clashing with the colors of the words when selecting character.

*- For some reason, number of player choice shows "8 players" instead of 2, despite the code being written for "2".

*- When 1 player is selected, dodge button shows "8=dodge" rather than "x=dodge", despite being coded correctly.
When 2 players is chosen, this problem occurs on the instruction for plaer 2, but player 1's instruction are right.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Transitions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*- When a boss is beat, the boss will stay drawn on the screen, into the overworld, and the screen change is instant, 
so maybe, as we mentioned before, create some form of death animation, to clear the boss off, then enter the overworld


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Game Over
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*- Similar to the main menu issue, the instructions for retrying shows what looks like an 8 but missing a pixel, 
so it looks almost like a 3. It should show an "x".

*- Retrying after player dies currently reloads the entire game from the start. Do we want to implement a checkpoint
system, allowing a player to restart from current boss? However, his would make the game much easier, allowing for 
players to have unlmited lives, so there is no reason to try their best to stay alive. Just a thought about this.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OverWorld
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*- Stomach boss entrance from overworld lands player into a pit, which causes instant death


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Heart Boss Fight
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- A visual effect showing that the valve is about to burst with an attack would be helpful to players.

- Heart could use maybe some more health, due to being able to beat it rather quickly. Subjective.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Stomach Boss Fight
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Boss does not have an idle state, meaning the battle begins instantly.

- Fruit pieces are not being shot directly from the mouth, rather from a upper right part of the boss

- Hard to tell what the player is supposed to do to deal damage. A player will die many times 
before they figure out that hitting an enzyme above the corresponding fruit will cause damage.
Not sure about a fix, maybe a visual like the fruit glows when the corresponding enzyme is out.

- Hard to hit the yellow enzyme. Player must jump in order to hit it. 
Maybe lower the hitbox slightly, or make it fly slightly lower.

- Yellow Enzyme also doesn't hit the player when they are standing still. The enzyme goes straight through.
Just a hitbox issue. The player is capable of being hit by it, by like jumping, but just not moving, the enzyme misses

- Can almost never hit the purple enzyme over the grape due to it starting above the grave, 
alloting a split second chance of having it fall above the grape. maybe make the enzyme start on the left side

- Similar issue with the red enzyme. It starts over the apple, leaving the player little time to react 
and hit the enzyme before it teleports elsewhere. Maybe start the red enzyme onthe otherside, 
or make it go through the same sequence a second or third time to give the player more of a chance to hit it.

*- Insta death from falling from the pit is difficult. This should be treated just as how the lung battle is 

*- Stomach only fires fruit pieces at player 1. Once player 1 dies, the stomach fires at the bottom left corner of 
the level, never at player 2.

- Seems like there is a limit to the amount of shots/time this boss has. After hitting stage 2, roughly after a minute 
or so, the game got harder as expected, shooting more and what not. But then after another 20-30 seconds, the boss 
stopped shooting fruit pieces and pillars stopped spawning in. It is not a set time thing, I tested waiting out the 
same time (~100 seconds) in just phase 1, but the fight kept going. Somewhere is a bug with how long it can go on for.

*- Pillars that come out of the pits no longer come up, they seem to be going down into the ground.
Could just be the equation used to move them.

*- Player is can walk "off the fruit platform" which appears as floating above the ground. We can either try to make 
collision more accurate to the actual fruit, or make the ground level with the fruit so there is no "floating".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lungs Boss Fight
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*- Player will randomnly take damage. Not debris hitting him.

*- The blow/suck can cause a player to get stuck in the side of a wall/platform, which then causes the player to slowly 
move through the corner until the player is on top of the platform/ground.

*-
